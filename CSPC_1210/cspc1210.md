Computer programs are abundant in many people's lives today, carrying out applications on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, powering businesses like Amazon and Netflix, helping cars drive and planes fly, and much more.
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:
	• Input: A program receives data from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
	• Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
	• Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as a file, screen, or network.
Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value "varying" as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.
Mathematical thinking became increasingly important throughout the industrial age, enabling people to successfully live and work. In the information age, many people believe computational thinking, or creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem, will become increasingly important for work and everyday life. A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an algorithm.
The Python interpreter is a computer program that executes code written in the Python programming language. An interactive interpreter is a program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time.
Code is a common word for the textual representation of a program (and hence programming is also called coding). A line is a row of text.
The interactive interpreter displays a prompt (">>>") that indicates the interpreter is ready to accept code. The user types a line of Python code and presses the enter key to execute the code. Initially, you may think of the interactive interpreter as a powerful calculator. The example program below calculates a salary based on a given hourly wage, the number of hours worked per week, and the number of weeks per year. The specifics of the code are described elsewhere in the chapter.
The Python interactive interpreter is useful for simple operations or programs consisting of only a few lines. However, entering code line-by-line into the interpreter quickly becomes unwieldy for any program spanning more than a few lines.
Instead, a programmer can write Python code in a file then provide that file to the interpreter. The interpreter begins by executing the first line of code at the top of the file and continues until the interpreter reaches the end.
	• A statement is a program instruction. A program mostly consists of a series of statements, and each statement usually appears on its own line.
	• An expression is a piece of code the interpreter evaluates to produce a value; for example, the code wage * hours * weeks is an expression that computes a number. The symbol * is used for multiplication. The names wage, hours, weeks, and salary are variables, which are named references to values stored by the interpreter.
	• A new variable is created by performing an assignment using the = symbol, such as salary = wage * hours * weeks, which creates a new variable called salary.
	• The print() function displays variables or expression values.
	• Characters such as "#" denote comments, which are optional but can be used to explain portions of code to a human reader.
	• Many code editors color certain words, as in the below program, to assist a human reader in understanding various words' roles.
Text is output from a Python program using the built-in function print( ). Ex: print("hello world!"). Text enclosed in quotes is known as a string. Text in strings may have letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like @ or #. Ex: "hello123@zybooks.com", "Welcome!", and "2005" are strings.
Output can be moved to the next line using the newline character "\n". Ex: print("1\n2\n3") prints "1" on the first line, "2" on the second line, and "3" on the third line of output. An output newline is the equivalent of pressing the Enter key on a keyboard to get to the next line.
print() always outputs an invisible newline character at the end of the statement.
The value of a variable can be printed out via: print(variable_name) (without quotes around the variable name). A single output line may include multiple strings and variables separated by commas. A space character is automatically added between each.
Each use of print() outputs on a new line. However, sometimes a programmer may want to keep output on the same line. Adding end=" " inside of print() keeps the output of the next print on the same line, separated by a single space character. Ex: print("Hello", end=" "). Any character, or multiple characters, can be used instead of a space character.
An escape sequence is a string that has a special meaning, like the newline character "\n", that always starts with a backslash "\". Other escape sequences exist, such as "\t" to insert a tab, or "\\" to print an actual backslash character.
Any space, tab, or newline is called whitespace.
Many useful programs allow a user to enter values, such as typing a number, a name, etc.
The input() function is used to read input from a user. The statement best_friend = input() will read text entered by the user, and assign the result as a new string to the best_friend variable. The input() function causes the program to wait until the user has entered text and pushed the return key.
The string "123" (with quotes) is fundamentally different from the integer 123 (without quotes). The "123" string is a sequence of the characters "1", "2", and "3" arranged in a certain order, whereas 123 represents the integer value one-hundred twenty-three. Strings and integers are each an example of a type; a type determines how a value can behave. For example, integers can be divided by 2, but not strings (what sense would "Hello" / 2 make?). Types are discussed in detail later on.
Reading from input always results in a string type. However, often a programmer wants to read in an integer, and then use that number in a calculation. If a string contains only numbers, like "123", then the int() function can be used to convert that string to the integer 123.
As soon as a person begins trying to program, that person will make mistakes. One kind of mistake, a syntax error, violates a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create a program. An example is putting multiple prints on the same line.
The interpreter will generate a message when encountering a syntax error. The error message will report the number of the offending line, in this case 7, allowing the programmer to fix the problem. Sometimes error messages can be confusing. Below, the message "invalid syntax" is not very precise but is the best information that the interpreter reports. With enough practice, a programmer becomes familiar with common errors and avoids them, preventing headaches later.
Note that syntax errors are found before the program is run by the interpreter. In the example below, none of the prints prior to the error is in the output.
The Python interpreter is able to detect syntax errors when the program is initially loaded, prior to actually executing any of the statements in the code. However, just because the program loads and executes does not mean the program is correct. The program may have another kind of error called a runtime error, in which a program's syntax is correct but the program attempts an impossible operation, such as dividing by zero or multiplying strings together (like "Hello" * "ABC").
A runtime error halts the execution of the program. Abrupt and unintended termination of a program is often called a crash of the program.
Consider the below program that begins executing, prints the salary, and then waits for the user to enter an integer value. The int() statement expects a number to be entered, but gets the text "Henry" instead.
Some errors may be subtle enough to silently misbehave, instead of causing a runtime error and a crash. An example might be if a programmer accidentally typed "2 * 4" rather than "2 * 40". The program would load correctly but would not behave as intended. Such an error is known as a logic error, because the program is logically flawed. A logic error is often called a bug.

When developing software, a programmer must write, run, test, and debug code. Each of these tasks can be performed with different software. Ex: A text editor is needed to write code, and a Python interpreter is needed to run the code. An integrated development environment (IDE) is software that integrates a text editor and a Python interpreter, often with additional tools. Ex: Most IDEs include the ability to edit multiple files, a file manager for finding and organizing files, shortcut buttons, a debugger to help a programmer find bugs, and a console for entering commands and executing programs.
IDEs support multiple programming languages and are widely used in software development. IDLE is the official IDE included with most installations of the Python language. Other common IDEs for Python include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and XCode.
Most IDEs do not come pre-installed with an operating system and must be installed separately. Some IDEs are run locally on a computer, while others are cloud-based and are run using a web browser.
IDEs contain many features that can make programming more efficient and convenient. Common IDE features include the following.
	• Syntax highlighting uses different colors for keywords, variables, strings, and other code syntax elements. Syntax highlighting can help a programmer identify errors such as unclosed quotes and parentheses, missing colons, and misspellings.
	• Automatic delimiter completion adds a matching closing quotation mark, parenthesis, bracket, or brace when a corresponding opening symbol is typed, which can help errors be more easily identified.
	• Shortcut buttons allow various predefined operations to be performed with a single click. Ex: A common shortcut button allows a program to be run quickly without having to enter a command to pass the source file to the Python interpreter.
	• A file manager and multiple text editor tabs for separate files allow different programs, input files, and output files to be easily accessed and edited.
An IDE typically includes a console for user input and program output. A console (or terminal) is a text-based interface that allows a user to run programs, enter input, and view program output.
A console's command-line interface (CLI) is an interface that allows a user to enter commands to run programs and work with files. One advantage of a CLI is the ability to run a program with command-line arguments. A command-line argument is a value entered by a user after the program name when running a program from a command line. Ex: In the command ls -a, ls is the name of the program and -a is a command-line argument.
