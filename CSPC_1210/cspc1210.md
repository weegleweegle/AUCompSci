Computer programs are abundant in many people's lives today, carrying out applications on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, powering businesses like Amazon and Netflix, helping cars drive and planes fly, and much more.
A computer program consists of instructions executing one at a time. Basic instruction types are:
	• Input: A program receives data from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.
	• Process: A program performs computations on that data, such as adding two values like x + y.
	• Output: A program puts that data somewhere, such as a file, screen, or network.
Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value "varying" as a program assigns a variable like x with new values.
Mathematical thinking became increasingly important throughout the industrial age, enabling people to successfully live and work. In the information age, many people believe computational thinking, or creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem, will become increasingly important for work and everyday life. A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an algorithm.
The Python interpreter is a computer program that executes code written in the Python programming language. An interactive interpreter is a program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time.
Code is a common word for the textual representation of a program (and hence programming is also called coding). A line is a row of text.
The interactive interpreter displays a prompt (">>>") that indicates the interpreter is ready to accept code. The user types a line of Python code and presses the enter key to execute the code. Initially, you may think of the interactive interpreter as a powerful calculator. The example program below calculates a salary based on a given hourly wage, the number of hours worked per week, and the number of weeks per year. The specifics of the code are described elsewhere in the chapter.
The Python interactive interpreter is useful for simple operations or programs consisting of only a few lines. However, entering code line-by-line into the interpreter quickly becomes unwieldy for any program spanning more than a few lines.
Instead, a programmer can write Python code in a file then provide that file to the interpreter. The interpreter begins by executing the first line of code at the top of the file and continues until the interpreter reaches the end.
	• A statement is a program instruction. A program mostly consists of a series of statements, and each statement usually appears on its own line.
	• An expression is a piece of code the interpreter evaluates to produce a value; for example, the code wage * hours * weeks is an expression that computes a number. The symbol * is used for multiplication. The names wage, hours, weeks, and salary are variables, which are named references to values stored by the interpreter.
	• A new variable is created by performing an assignment using the = symbol, such as salary = wage * hours * weeks, which creates a new variable called salary.
	• The print() function displays variables or expression values.
	• Characters such as "#" denote comments, which are optional but can be used to explain portions of code to a human reader.
	• Many code editors color certain words, as in the below program, to assist a human reader in understanding various words' roles.
Text is output from a Python program using the built-in function print( ). Ex: print("hello world!"). Text enclosed in quotes is known as a string. Text in strings may have letters, numbers, spaces, or symbols like @ or #. Ex: "hello123@zybooks.com", "Welcome!", and "2005" are strings.
Output can be moved to the next line using the newline character "\n". Ex: print("1\n2\n3") prints "1" on the first line, "2" on the second line, and "3" on the third line of output. An output newline is the equivalent of pressing the Enter key on a keyboard to get to the next line.
print() always outputs an invisible newline character at the end of the statement.
The value of a variable can be printed out via: print(variable_name) (without quotes around the variable name). A single output line may include multiple strings and variables separated by commas. A space character is automatically added between each.
Each use of print() outputs on a new line. However, sometimes a programmer may want to keep output on the same line. Adding end=" " inside of print() keeps the output of the next print on the same line, separated by a single space character. Ex: print("Hello", end=" "). Any character, or multiple characters, can be used instead of a space character.
An escape sequence is a string that has a special meaning, like the newline character "\n", that always starts with a backslash "\". Other escape sequences exist, such as "\t" to insert a tab, or "\\" to print an actual backslash character.
Any space, tab, or newline is called whitespace.
Many useful programs allow a user to enter values, such as typing a number, a name, etc.
The input() function is used to read input from a user. The statement best_friend = input() will read text entered by the user, and assign the result as a new string to the best_friend variable. The input() function causes the program to wait until the user has entered text and pushed the return key.
The string "123" (with quotes) is fundamentally different from the integer 123 (without quotes). The "123" string is a sequence of the characters "1", "2", and "3" arranged in a certain order, whereas 123 represents the integer value one-hundred twenty-three. Strings and integers are each an example of a type; a type determines how a value can behave. For example, integers can be divided by 2, but not strings (what sense would "Hello" / 2 make?). Types are discussed in detail later on.
Reading from input always results in a string type. However, often a programmer wants to read in an integer, and then use that number in a calculation. If a string contains only numbers, like "123", then the int() function can be used to convert that string to the integer 123.
As soon as a person begins trying to program, that person will make mistakes. One kind of mistake, a syntax error, violates a programming language's rules on how symbols can be combined to create a program. An example is putting multiple prints on the same line.
The interpreter will generate a message when encountering a syntax error. The error message will report the number of the offending line, in this case 7, allowing the programmer to fix the problem. Sometimes error messages can be confusing. Below, the message "invalid syntax" is not very precise but is the best information that the interpreter reports. With enough practice, a programmer becomes familiar with common errors and avoids them, preventing headaches later.
Note that syntax errors are found before the program is run by the interpreter. In the example below, none of the prints prior to the error is in the output.
The Python interpreter is able to detect syntax errors when the program is initially loaded, prior to actually executing any of the statements in the code. However, just because the program loads and executes does not mean the program is correct. The program may have another kind of error called a runtime error, in which a program's syntax is correct but the program attempts an impossible operation, such as dividing by zero or multiplying strings together (like "Hello" * "ABC").
A runtime error halts the execution of the program. Abrupt and unintended termination of a program is often called a crash of the program.
Consider the below program that begins executing, prints the salary, and then waits for the user to enter an integer value. The int() statement expects a number to be entered, but gets the text "Henry" instead.
Some errors may be subtle enough to silently misbehave, instead of causing a runtime error and a crash. An example might be if a programmer accidentally typed "2 * 4" rather than "2 * 40". The program would load correctly but would not behave as intended. Such an error is known as a logic error, because the program is logically flawed. A logic error is often called a bug.

When developing software, a programmer must write, run, test, and debug code. Each of these tasks can be performed with different software. Ex: A text editor is needed to write code, and a Python interpreter is needed to run the code. An integrated development environment (IDE) is software that integrates a text editor and a Python interpreter, often with additional tools. Ex: Most IDEs include the ability to edit multiple files, a file manager for finding and organizing files, shortcut buttons, a debugger to help a programmer find bugs, and a console for entering commands and executing programs.
IDEs support multiple programming languages and are widely used in software development. IDLE is the official IDE included with most installations of the Python language. Other common IDEs for Python include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and XCode.
Most IDEs do not come pre-installed with an operating system and must be installed separately. Some IDEs are run locally on a computer, while others are cloud-based and are run using a web browser.
IDEs contain many features that can make programming more efficient and convenient. Common IDE features include the following.
	• Syntax highlighting uses different colors for keywords, variables, strings, and other code syntax elements. Syntax highlighting can help a programmer identify errors such as unclosed quotes and parentheses, missing colons, and misspellings.
	• Automatic delimiter completion adds a matching closing quotation mark, parenthesis, bracket, or brace when a corresponding opening symbol is typed, which can help errors be more easily identified.
	• Shortcut buttons allow various predefined operations to be performed with a single click. Ex: A common shortcut button allows a program to be run quickly without having to enter a command to pass the source file to the Python interpreter.
	• A file manager and multiple text editor tabs for separate files allow different programs, input files, and output files to be easily accessed and edited.
An IDE typically includes a console for user input and program output. A console (or terminal) is a text-based interface that allows a user to run programs, enter input, and view program output.
A console's command-line interface (CLI) is an interface that allows a user to enter commands to run programs and work with files. One advantage of a CLI is the ability to run a program with command-line arguments. A command-line argument is a value entered by a user after the program name when running a program from a command line. Ex: In the command ls -a, ls is the name of the program and -a is a command-line argument.

When people in the 1800s began using electricity for lights and machines, they created switches to turn objects on and off. A switch controls whether or not electricity flows through a wire. In the early 1900s, people created special switches that could be controlled electronically, rather than by a person moving the switch up or down. In an electronically controlled switch, a positive voltage at the control input allows electricity to flow, while a zero voltage prevents the flow. Such switches were useful for routing telephone calls. Engineers realized they could use electronically controlled switches to perform simple calculations. The engineers treated a positive voltage as a "1" and a zero voltage as a "0". 0s and 1s are known as bits (binary digits). They built connections of switches, or circuits, to perform calculations such as multiplying two numbers.
To support different calculations, circuits called processors were created to process (or execute) a list of desired calculations, each called an instruction. The instructions were specified by configuring external switches, as in the images below. Processors used to take up entire rooms. Today, these processors fit on a chip about the size of a postage stamp, containing millions or even billions of switches.
Instructions are stored in a memory. A memory is a circuit that can store 0s and 1s in each of a series of thousands of addressed locations, like a series of addressed mailboxes that each can store an envelope (the 0s and 1s). Instructions operate on data, which is also stored in memory locations as 0s and 1s.
For example, the instruction "Mul 97, #9, 98" would multiply the data in memory location 97 by 9, storing the result into memory location 98. So if the data in location 97 were 20, then the instruction would multiply 20 by 9, storing the result 180 into location 98. That instruction would actually be stored in memory as 0s and 1s, such as "011 1100001 001001 1100010", where 011 specifies a multiply instruction, and 1100001, 001001, and 1100010 represent 97, 9, and 98 (as described previously). The following animation illustrates the storage of instructions and data in memory for a program that computes F = (9*C)/5 + 32, where C is memory location 97 and F is memory location 99.
The programmer-created sequence of instructions is called a program, application, or just app.

When powered on, the processor starts by executing the instruction at location 0, then location 1, then location 2, etc. The above program performs the calculation over and over again. If location 97 is connected to external switches and location 99 to external lights, then a computer user (like the women in the above picture) could set the switches to represent a particular Celsius number, and the computer would automatically output the Fahrenheit number using the lights.
In the 1940s, programmers originally wrote each instruction using 0s and 1s, such as "001 1100001 001001 1100010". Instructions represented as 0s and 1s are known as machine instructions, and a sequence of machine instructions together form an executable program (or an executable). Because 0s and 1s are hard to comprehend, programmers soon created programs called assemblers to automatically translate instructions for humans, such as "Mul 97, #9, 98", known as assembly language instructions, into machine instructions. The assembler program thus helped programmers write more complex programs.

In the 1960s and 1970s, programmers created high-level languages to support programming using formulas or algorithms, so a programmer could write a formula such as F = (9 / 5) * C + 32. Early high-level languages included FORTRAN (for "Formula Translator") or ALGOL (for "Algorithmic Language"), which were more closely related to how humans thought than were machine or assembly instructions.

To support high-level languages, programmers created compilers, which are programs that automatically translate high-level language programs into executable programs.

The term computer has changed meaning over the years. The term originally referred to a person that performed computations by hand, akin to an accountant ("We need to hire a computer.") In the 1940s/1950s, the term began to refer to large machines like in the earlier photo. In the 1970s/1980s, the term expanded to also refer to smaller home/office computers known as personal computers or PCs ("personal" because the computer wasn't shared among multiple users like the large ones) and to portable/laptop computers. In the 2000s/2010s, the term may also cover other computing devices like pads, book readers, and smart phones. The term computer even refers to computing devices embedded inside other electronic devices such as medical equipment, automobiles, aircraft, consumer electronics, military systems, etc.

In the early days of computing, the physical equipment was prone to failures. As equipment became more stable and as programs became larger, the term software became popular to distinguish a computer's programs from the hardware on which they ran.

A computer typically consists of several components (see animation below):

Input/output devices: A screen (or monitor) displays items to a user. The above examples displayed textual items, but today's computers display graphical items, too. A keyboard allows a user to provide input to the computer, typically accompanied by a mouse for graphical displays. Keyboards and mice are increasingly being replaced by touchscreens. Other devices provide additional input and output means, such as microphones, speakers, printers, and USB interfaces. I/O devices are commonly called peripherals.

Storage: A solid-state drive (SSD) uses flash memory to store files and other data, such as program files, song/movie files, or office documents. SSDs are non-volatile, meaning they maintain their contents even when powered off. The SSD's flash memory stores 0s and 1s by tunneling electrons into special circuits on the memory's chip and extracting the bits with a "flash" of electricity that draws the electrons back out. SSDs replace hard disk drives used in older personal computers. Hard disk drives use spinning magnetic disks that are slower and consume more energy than SSDs.

Memory: RAM (random-access memory) temporarily holds data read from storage and is designed such that any address can be accessed much faster than SSD and disk. The "random access" term comes from being able to access any memory location quickly and in arbitrary order, without having to spin a disk to get a proper location under a head. RAM is costlier per bit than SSD and disk, due to RAM's higher speed. RAM chips typically appear on a printed-circuit board along with a processor chip. RAM is volatile, losing its contents when powered off. Memory size is typically listed in bits or in bytes, where a byte is 8 bits. Common sizes involve megabytes (million bytes), gigabytes (billion bytes), or terabytes (trillion bytes).

Processor: The processor runs the computer's programs, reading and executing instructions from memory, performing operations, and reading/writing data from/to memory. When powered on, the processor starts executing the program whose first instruction is (typically) at memory location 0. That program is commonly called the BIOS (basic input/output system), which sets up the computer's basic peripherals. The processor then begins executing a program called an operating system (OS). The operating system allows a user to run other programs and interfaces with the many other peripherals. Processors are also called CPUs (central processing units) or microprocessors (a term introduced when processors began fitting on a single chip, the "micro-" suggesting something small). Because speed is so important, a processor may contain a small amount of RAM on its own chip, called cache memory, accessible in one clock tick rather than several, for maintaining a copy of the most-used instructions/data.

Clock: A processor's instructions execute at a rate governed by the processor's clock, which ticks at a specific frequency. Processors have clocks that tick at rates such as 1 MHz (1 million ticks/second) for an inexpensive processor ($1) like those found in a microwave oven or washing machine, to 1 GHz (1 billion ticks/second) for costlier ($10-$100) processors like those found in mobile phones and desktop computers. Executing about 1 instruction per clock tick, processors thus execute millions or billions of instructions per second.

Computers typically run multiple programs simultaneously, such as a web browser, an office application, a photo editing program, etc. The operating system actually runs a little of program A, then a little of program B, etc., switching between programs thousands of times a second.
After computers were invented and occupied entire rooms, engineers created smaller switches called transistors, which in 1958 were integrated onto a single chip called an integrated circuit, or IC. Engineers continued to make transistors smaller, leading to Moore's Law: the doubling of IC capacity roughly every 18 months, which continued for several decades.

Note: Moore actually said every 2 years. And the actual trend has varied from 18 months. The key is that doubling occurred roughly every two years, causing much improvement over time. Wikipedia: Moore's law.

By 1971, Intel produced the first single-IC processor named the 4004, called a microprocessor (micro- suggesting something small), having 2,300 transistors. New, more powerful microprocessors appeared every few years, and by 2012, a single IC had several billion transistors containing multiple processors (each called a core).
A side note: A common way to make a PC faster is to add more RAM. A processor spends much of its time moving instructions/data between memory and storage, because not all of a program's instructions/data may fit in memory—akin to a chef who spends most of his/her time walking back and forth between a stove and pantry. Just as adding a larger table next to the stove allows more ingredients to be kept close by, a larger memory allows more instructions/data to be kept close to the processor. Moore's Law results in RAM being cheaper a few years after buying a PC, so adding RAM to a several-year-old PC can yield good speedups for little cost.
As computing evolved throughout the 1960s and '70s, programmers created scripting languages to execute programs without the need for compilation. A script is a program whose instructions are executed by another program called an interpreter. Interpreted execution is slower because it requires multiple interpreter instructions to execute one script instruction. But the advantages include avoiding the compilation step during programming and running the same script on different processors as long as each processor has an interpreter installed.

In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum began creating a scripting language called Python and an accompanying interpreter. He derived Python from an existing language called ABC. The name Python came from the TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which van Rossum was a fan. The goals for the language included simplicity and readability, while providing as much power and flexibility as other scripting languages such as Perl.

Python 1.0 was released in 1994 with support for some functional programming constructs derived from Lisp. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced automatic memory management (garbage collection) and features from Haskell and other languages. Python 2 officially reached "end-of-life" (no more fixes or support) in 2020 (Source: Python.org). Python 3.0 was released in 2008 to rectify various language design issues. Python 2.7 still remained popular for years, due largely to third-party libraries supporting only Python 2.7. Python 3.0 is not backward compatible, so Python 2.7 programs cannot run on Python 3.0 or later interpreters. However, Python 3.x versions have become widely used as new projects adopted the version.

Python is an open-source language, meaning the user community participates in defining the language and creating new interpreters. The language is also supported by a large community of programmers. A May 2025 survey that measures the popularity of various programming languages has found that Python (25.35%) is the most popular language.

For program output, whitespace is any blank space or newline. Most coding activities require a student program's output to match exactly the expected output, including whitespace. Students learning programming often complain:
Programming is all about precision. Programs must be created precisely to run correctly. Ex:

= and == have different meanings.
Using i where j was meant can yield a hard-to-find bug.
Not considering that n could be 0 in sum/n can cause a program to fail entirely in rare but not insignificant cases.
Counting from i being 0 to i < 10 vs. i <= 10 can mean the difference between correct output and a program outputting garbage.
In programming, every little detail counts. Programmers must pay extreme attention to detail.

Thus, another reason for caring about whitespace in program output is to help new programmers get into a "precision" mindset when programming. Paying careful attention to details like whitespace instructions, carefully examining feedback regarding whitespace differences, and then modifying a program to exactly match expected whitespace are exercises that strengthen attention to detail. Such attention can lead programmers to make fewer mistakes when creating programs, spend less time debugging, and instead create programs that work correctly.
